# Database Design Document contains the following:
	• Specialization and generalization relationship with entities and diagrammatic representation of
	  overlap and disjoint constraints.
	• DBMS physical ERD, Conceptual ERD diagram and DBMS physical ERD with attributes.
	• Fashion anytime database relationship classification and associative mapping.

	• Scripts are organized by database system (Oracle11g and SQL developer 20.4.1)

# Database Models
	Conceptul ERD,Entity-Relationship(ER) Diagrams, DBMSERD with attributes are created
	to support the database.Please use a freely available tool for creating ER diagram files.
	Always export the ER diagram as a PDF or PNG image file so others can view the diagram without
	using a specific tool.
